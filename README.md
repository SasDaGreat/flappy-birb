# flappy-birb
A Flappy Bird clone written in Python using the pygame module, with the occasional German inside meme (or germeme, as I like to call it) added in. It's open source, for all of you to marvel at how bad, messy and unreadable code can be. Might even be able to create my own esoteric programming language with this! (I'll probably try updating the code to adhere to PEP 8 standards in the future - that is, if I even understand the code by that point.)

This is a gift, if you will, for the German Learning Discord server. Thanks for being an awesome community, guys!

All of the sprites (except for the math obstacle image) and sounds were either made by me, or modified from other resources. The bad music for the title screen as well as Germeme mode was made my me.

The game doesn't need Python or pygame to run. It *does* need a cookie - chocolate, please - sent directly to my doorstep to run though, so... cough up.


__Controls:__
While ingame, press up/Space to jump/flap, down to stop moving upwards if you are (this helps in keeping from 'overhopping' - that term belongs to me now, pay 5 dollars to use it), and Escape to automatically die and exit the game afterwards.

__Objective:__
Don't die. And avoid the Austrian memer at all costs.


Here's a playthrough of the game (*it isn't supposed to be this laggy, my recorder slows down the PC*): https://youtu.be/rlTeUOd0J6g

Infringing this will result in stale German memes being delivered to your house.
